This is the github repo for our (mine and [andresc02](https://github.com/andresc02])'s) youtube-channel. We irregularly upload mostly german videos about arduino and electronics. As we used this channel to learn about electronics ourselves, the topics are broadly distributed.

For questions, you may contact us via [email](mailto:roboter.tutorials.german@gmail.com). Please don't expect an immediate answer, but don't worry, we check it more often than we upload new videos.
